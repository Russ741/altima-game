# Altima Game

Something I made for a friend who was having a bad car day. Now with sound!

Check it out [here](https://russ741.github.io/altima-game/).

# Deployment Process

From the ```altima_game``` directory in the [altima-game](https://github.com/Russ741/altima-game) repository:
```
flutter build web --base-href "/altima-game/"
rm -rf ../docs/*
cp -R build/web/* ../docs
git add ../
git commit -m "INSERT NEW REVISION NOTE HERE"
git push
```

As of the time of writing, the --base-href flag parsing was a bit flaky. On some platforms, flutter build would complain with:
```
base-href should start and end with /
```
Even when the flag value does.
